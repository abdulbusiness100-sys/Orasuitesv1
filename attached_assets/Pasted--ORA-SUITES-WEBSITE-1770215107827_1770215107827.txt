ORA SUITES WEBSITE BUILD — REPLIT AI PROMPT (UPDATED)
================================================================================

CONTEXT:
You are building a website for Ora Suites, a women-only beauty and wellness sanctuary in Manchester. This is NOT a transactional clinic—it is a refined, elevated space where women come to transform, not just treat. The brand is rooted in simplicity, luxury, and emotional resonance.

CRITICAL: Avoid the mistakes of competitors like Derma Transform (generic messaging, weak visuals, transactional tone, poor UX). Ora must feel like a sanctuary, not a service provider.

================================================================================

VISUAL STYLE:
- High-quality, warm-toned photography
